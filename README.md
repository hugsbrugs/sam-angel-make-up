You can use this repository as a start to build your own website by customizing it the same way I customized the [Start Bootstrap Grayscale Template](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/). Not reinventing the wheel for each website ;)

This website was originaly hosted on Github Pages by using build-gh-pages.sh script. If you don't need any backend (like for contact form), it's a good free place to start.
